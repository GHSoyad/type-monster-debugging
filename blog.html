                        <em class="blog-author"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>Golam Hasnain Soyad</em>
                        <p>The main difference between local storage and session storage is that data saved in local
                            storage stays in browser until it is removed manually, but data in session storage gets
                            removed once the tab or browser is closed.</p>

                        <em class="blog-author"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>Golam Hasnain Soyad</em>
                        <p>JavaScript event loop monitors the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
                            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                            Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                        <h3>Difference Between Global Scope and Block Scope</h3>
                        <em class="blog-author"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>Golam Hasnain Soyad</em>
                        <p>JavaScript variables have only two scopes. A global variable has a global scope which means
                            it can be defined anywhere in JavaScript code and it is accessible from anywhere in the
                            code. On the other hand block scope variables declared inside blocks of the if or switch
                            conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or
                            loop.

                        <h3>How Many Ways Can We Get Undefined in JavaScript</h3>
                        <em class="blog-author"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>Golam Hasnain Soyad</em>
                        <p>There are 8 ways to get undefined in Javascript. 1) When we declare a variable without
                            assigning any value, 2) When we have a function that doesn't have return, 3) When we have a
                            function with return but it doesn't have anything to return, 4) When we have a function
                            parameter that never received a value, 5) When we try to access array element that doesn't
                            exist in the array index, 6) When we try to delete an array element from a index that
                            doesn't exist, 7) When we try to access an object property that doesn't exist, 8) When we
                            set value of a variable as undefined.</p>
